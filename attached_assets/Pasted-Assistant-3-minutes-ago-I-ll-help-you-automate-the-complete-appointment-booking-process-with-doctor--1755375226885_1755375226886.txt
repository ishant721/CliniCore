I'll help you automate the complete appointment booking process with doctor schedules, lab test referrals, and automated follow-ups. This will require several enhancements to your existing system.

Let me start by creating a comprehensive appointment automation system:

doctor/models.py
Add DoctorSchedule model for managing doctor availability, Add automated appointment status and lab referral tracking, Add fields for automated appointment management
Now let's create the automated appointment booking system:

doctor/appointment_automation.py
Create automated appointment scheduling system
Now let's update the booking view to use the automated system:

doctor/views.py
Update booking view to use automated appointment scheduling, Update prescription creation to automatically schedule lab appointments, Add doctor schedule management view
Now let's update the prescription creation to automatically schedule lab tests:

Let's create a view for doctors to set their schedules:

Let's create the template for doctor schedule settings:

templates/doctor-schedule-settings.html
Create template for doctor schedule settings
Now let's update the URLs to include our new views:

doctor/urls.py
Add URLs for automated appointment features
Let's create a background task to automatically check for completed lab reports and schedule follow-ups:

hospital/management/commands/schedule_follow_ups.py
Create management command for scheduling follow-up appointments
Let's also update the lab worker's report creation to trigger follow-up scheduling:

hospital_admin/views.py
Update report creation to trigger follow-up appointment scheduling
Let's create the email template for follow-up appointments:

templates/follow-up-appointment-mail.html
Create email template for follow-up appointment notifications
Finally, let's update the doctor dashboard to show the automated appointment features:

templates/doctor-sidebar.html
Add automated appointment links to doctor sidebar
Now run the migrations to create the new database tables:

python manage.py makemigrations doctor
python manage.py migrate
This comprehensive automation system provides:

Doctor Schedule Management: Doctors can set their weekly schedules with working hours and patient limits
Automated Appointment Booking: When patients book appointments, the system finds the next available slot based on doctor availability
Lab Test Automation: When doctors prescribe lab tests, lab appointments are automatically scheduled
Follow-up Scheduling: After lab reports are completed, follow-up appointments with the original doctor are automatically scheduled
Email Notifications: Patients receive automated emails about scheduled appointments
Background Tasks: Management command to check for completed reports and schedule follow-ups
The system now handles the complete workflow:

Patient books appointment → System finds next available slot based on doctor's schedule
Doctor sees patient and prescribes tests → Lab appointment automatically scheduled
Lab completes tests → Follow-up appointment with doctor automatically scheduled
All parties receive email notifications throughout the process
